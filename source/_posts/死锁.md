最近在看 `concurrency in go` 的时候看到了在并发的执行代码过程中，很容易产生死锁的问题，后就查了些资料做个总结

## 死锁产生的必要条件

1. **Mutual Exclusion**

   A concurrent process holds exclusive rights to a resource at any one time.

2. **Wait For Condition**

   A concurrent process must simultaneously hold a resource and be waiting for an
   additional resource.

3. **No Preemption**

   A resource held by a concurrent process can only be released by that process, so
   it fulfills this condition.

4. **Circular Wait**

   A concurrent process (P1) must be waiting on a chain of other concurrent pro‐
   cesses (P2), which are in turn waiting on it (P1), so it fulfills this final condition
   too.
